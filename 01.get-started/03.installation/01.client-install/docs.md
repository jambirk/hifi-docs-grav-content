<!-- Summaary: Since there are several download options, this page should help users understand which is right for them. The use of bulleted lists didn't seem to make sense, so I cleaned that up. The differences between the client vs client and sandbox installers were tangled up in the existing draft, so I split them out. -->

<!-- Two download options were mentioned (HF and Steam), but the link to Steam was buried on a linked page, so adding a second link. It's possible this was intentional and you want to encourage users to download directly instead of on Steam, but in the absence of clear guidance against that the best practice would be to offer all options, incliuding the Google play link that was buried on a following page. Also, the best way to make readers ignore the installation information is to put it after the download link, so best to move the actual links to the end of the page. It's still a short page. Finally, having a link on the word "here" looked amateurish in 2002, better to have the link be the name of the thing being downloaded or the web page title of the target page. -->
<!--
* Select your platform and download the installer.
* Run the High Fidelity installer.
* Follow the prompts and complete the installation.
* Run High Fidelity's Interface. --> 
<!-- This is all obvious and repated in the link they'll follow. Better to remove these.  -->

There are several options for installing the High Fidelity client:

+ Client only (available on High Fidelity or Steam)
+ Mobile App for Daydream-enabled Android devices (on Google Play)

If you want to create your own content you would download:

+ Client + Sandbox (available on High Fidelity) 

**Client only**

The client only installer <!-- uses the same packaging code as the server/client installer. This means it looks and behaves mostly the same, but -->does not include the Sandbox, <!-- the part about packaging code seemed to add little --> and is named "High Fidelity Interface" which is also its default install location. It allows you to to:
  - create a desktop shortcut for the client  <!-- Bullet list now starts with verbs and is introduced by a full colon, each forms a different true statement when combined with the intro -->
  - launch the client after the install
  - perform a clean install (removing older settings and content)
  - copy settings and content from a production install (for PR builds) <!-- This looks like something I'm guessing would be useful to developer users more than non-developer users.  -->
  
You can download High Fidelity's client-only Interface from: 

+ [High Fidelity](https://highfidelity.com/download/client).
+ [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/390540/High_Fidelity/) 
+ [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.highfidelity.hifiinterface) (Daydream-enabled Android devices) 

 
 > > > > > The installer will remember your choice of Express or Custom installation for the next time you update High Fidelity. 
 
 **Client + Sandbox**
 
The Client + Sandbox installer will confirm that you want to install "High Fidelity Interface" for the client and "High Fidelity Sandbox" for developer tools. This installer is named "High Fidelity" which is also its default install location.  It shows all related install options, and it allows you to:
  - create a desktop shortcut for the client <!-- parallel updates to match prior list -->
  - launch the Interface after the install
  - perform a clean install (removing older settings and content)
  - copy settings and content from a production install (for PR builds) 

Download the [High Fidelity Client + Sandbox](https://highfidelity.com/download/sandbox) and then [Learn how you can create and explore](https://docs.highfidelity.com/create-and-explore) in High Fidelity. <!-- This feels like an additional information link, doesn't fit where it was earlier in the article. -->
